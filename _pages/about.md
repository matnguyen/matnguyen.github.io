Hi! I'm Matthew Nguyen, a PhD student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. I am currently working under the supervision of [Dr. Michael Schatz](https://schatz-lab.org/), developing methods for large-scale long-read metagenomic analyses. 

Research
======
I’ve had the privilege of working with PIs whose guidance has been instrumental throughout my scientific career. At Simon Fraser University, [Dr. Leonid Chindelevitch](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/l.chindelevitch) introduced me to the field of bioinformatics, where we developed methods for genomic analyses of bacterial pathogens. Alongside [Dr. Maxwell Libbrecht](https://www.libbrechtlab.com/), we developed a method for predicting antimicrobial resistance in _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. I also worked on lymphoma genomics and optimizing variant calling with [Dr. Ryan Morin](https://morinlab.github.io/team/). During my M.Sc. at the University of British Columbia, I was advised by [Dr. William Hsiao](https://www.sfu.ca/fhs/about/people/profiles/william-hsiao.html) and was part of [The Centre for Infectious Disease Genomics and One Health](https://cidgoh.ca/), studying the genomic composition of multi-drug resistant _E. coli_ in Qatar. 

For my PhD research, I work on applying deep learning approaches for taxonomic classification that are scalable to large amounts of data obtained from long-read metagenomic sequencing.  

Background
======
I grew up in Vancouver, BC (the Canadian one!), and attended Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School (2015). I obtained my Joint B.Sc. in Computer Science and Molecular Biology & Biochemistry from Simon Fraser University in 2020. I also received my M.Sc. in Bioinformatics from the University of British Columbia in 2023.
